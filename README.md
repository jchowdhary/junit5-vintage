Simple Example which shows how we can modify pom.xml/gradle file so that we can have beloe scenerio's executed
 - For Running old Junit4 Test Classes with Junit5 , we need to add the  dependencies for junit-platform-surefire-provider and junit-vintage-engine plugin with maven –surefire-plugin 

 - To execute Both New JUnit5 and Old JUnit4 Test Classes together, we need to add the dependency for junit-jupiter-engine.

 - To execute only New JUnit5 Test Classes, we need  to add  the dependency for junit-jupiter-engine and  use maven-compiler-plugin to run the test classes.

 - Add junit-platform-runner for executing tests and test suites on the JUnit Platform in a JUnit 4 environment(like in Eclipse IDE till it supports JUnit5).
